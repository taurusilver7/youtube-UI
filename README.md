# Youtube Video sharing UI

> A react powered video sharing application, with styled components & functional components with hooks.

## Build

Refactor the starter template to suit the basic requirements of the application.
import `react-router-dom` and `styled-components` dependencies to the build.

Split the index page into Menu & Main components wrapped in a Container. The Main component holds a Navbar & Video Wrapper components.
Split the Menu & Main components in 1:7 aspect ratio on the screen.

- Create nav buttons in the Menu components and customize a theme provider. Creata a state to mangage the theme modes.

Style the Navbar with an Input & Search styled-components. Add the sign-in button from Menu component.

- Add specific routes to the project to add navigation between pages. The main routes are the index & video pages (with an video:id) identifier.

- Create the Card component to display the video thumbnails in the home page.

- Specify the routes for navigating between the home & videos pages using the Link elements.
- Style the Video component, add the features into the components.
- Create a comments wrappers, and an induvidual comment component.

- The Recommendation section has video thumbnails as in the home page, but in horizontal display. Use props to change the orientation of the component and other minor adjustments.

Custom utility class: `display: ${(props) => props.type === 'sm' && "flex"}`

- Add hover effects on menu buttons in the home page.

## Login Component

- Add a route to the routes for Login page. Create a login page in the pages. Style the login form for sign-in and register fields in the login form with styled-components.

## UI - Server.

- Create a state to manage the fetched videos from the server & a useEffect() to fetch the data on refresh.

- Map the fetched items into the Card component, and populate the data-values in the component.

- Import axios and fetch the data from server API endpoint. Create a proxy in the package.json to avoid repetetions.

- Add two more paths to the App (trends & sub) and add the route paths in the Menu component. If the axios fetch doesn't respond to the proxy, restart the react-app to kickstart the server to link up with the react-application.

- Implement the sign-in function on the UI. create pieces of states for every input field & populate the values to an handler function.

- The handler function fires a post request to the server to provide with the user data to the UI.
  To populate the user information in various no-linking components, a context-api, or a global state-management is imported.

### Redux-toolkit.

- Create a userSlice in /redux directory. Import the [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) dependency.

- Create a redux store in `/app/store.js`. Import the configuration API from redux toolkit.
- Make the redux store available to react by putting a react-redux provider around the application `App` in `src/index.js`. Pass the store as props in the Provider.

- Create a redux state slice in `/redux/userSlice.js` & import createSlice method from redux-toolkit.
- Create an initial state to the store. The initial state of the user is null, and upon fetching the data from the login page, update the state of the user. On failure, an error is displayed.

- Create reducer actions {loginStart, loginSuccess, loginFailure, logout} and assign corresponding state and action.payload to them.

- Add the userReducer to the redux store. And fire the dispatch events in the handleLogin function in Login page.

- The actions dispatched changes the initial state with a user data. Analyze the state changes in Redux toolkit google extension.

- Use the currentUser state data in several unrelated components (far away non-child components) - Navbar & Menu.
- Change the Avatar image, currentUser name in the Navbar. Add an video create button. Hide the login block in the Menu component.

- Import `redux-persist` library to make persistant user login. Import the necessary middlewares to persist the function, and make the store persist with a persisitor from the library.

- Wrap the App component with persistStore & add the persistor as props. The application will remain persistant with te login.

- To add google Authentcation to the project, add a firebase project and google Provider to the react application. Post the user details to the server, to create the sign-in method with google in the auth controller.

- Create a videoSlice in the store for handling video related actions.
- In the Video page, employ useLocation() hook from react-router-dom to trace the url path. split the path name to get the video_url into the recommandation cards.
- Set two states to manage the video & channels, and fetch the data from server.
